Basically, I got a bit fed up of developing web apps on lousy connections and having my fonts not load because they were hosted on Google, so I wrote this tool to save anyone else the trouble.\r\n\r\nHere's how it works.\r\n\r\n```\r\nnpm install fontbomb -g\r\ncd public/\r\nfontbomb \"http://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Seymour+One|Chango\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nFontbomb will then go away and collect all required .ttf/.woff and CSS files and add them straight into your project*.\r\n\r\nThen just reference the stylesheet created at `css/fonts.css` from your HTML file, and you'll be able to use all of those new fonts, but you'll be serving them yourself.\r\n\r\n\\* Fontbomb will create the folders if they aren't there. \r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
